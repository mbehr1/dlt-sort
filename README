dlt_sort: sorting tool for dlt log and trace files (like cat, sort).

Main purpose:

- Sort dlt messages inside dlt files by timestamp instead of the time of
  arrival at the logger. The dlt log messages itself stay untouched. They
  will just be moved within the log file.
- Merge multiple log files into a single file. This eases handling with e.g. 
  the dlt-viewer tool.
- Merge log files from different ECUs into a single file. The main benefit here
  is that the timestamps will be adjusted so that they get sorted by the real
  time and not by the time of arrival at the logger. See details below.
- Detect different lifecycles within the log files and split the log files 
  automatically by lifecycles.


To build:

under OSX:

use the provided XCode project.

under Linux/Windows:

g++ main.cpp -o dlt_sort[.exe] -I <path_to_dlt_include_dir>


Usage:

see dlt_sort --help

Examples:

1. simply sort a single file: 
    dlt_sort input.dlt
will generate a file named dlt_sorted.dlt containing the logs sorted by
dlt timestamp.

2. Merge two log files into a single file:
    dlt_sort input1.dlt input2.dlt
will generate a file named out.dlt containing the logs from both input files 
sorted by dlt timestamp (and adjusted if they are from multiple ecus.)

3. Split by lifecycle:
    dlt_sort -f dlt_sorted_ -s input1.dlt
will generate files named dlt_sorted_001.dlt (and ..._xxx.dlt).
